![](Average Sales per Genre.png)

From the Figure above, it is evident that Young Adult books is estimated to have the highest level of gross sales on average and Non-fiction is estimated to have the least level of gross sales on average. The mean of Young Adult books is 874,487.6 95% CI [841,635.5, 907,339.7]. The mean of Thriller books is 765,728.9 95% CI [726,438.1, 805,019.7]. The mean of Non-Fiction books is 722,871.9 95% CI [686,977, 758,766.5].

The loss is -42,856.96 95% CI [-103,591.2, 17,877.29]in the level of gross sales of Non-fiction when compared to Thriller books. The loss is 151,615.69 95% CI [-212,349.9, -90,881.43] level of gross sales of Non-fiction when compared to Young Adult books, and a loss in the level of gross sales of Thriller when compared to Young Adult is -108758.73 95% CI [-169,493, -48,024.47].

NHST: There is a significant mean in the level of gross sales of 722,871.9 for Non-fiction books,t(133)=39.834, p<0.0001.There is a significant mean in the level of gross sales for of 765,728.9 for Thriller books,t(133)=38.548, p<0.0001, and for Young adult books, there is a significant mean in the level of gross sales of  874,487.6,t(133)=52.651, p<0.0001

Using ANOVA:

After conducting ANOVA, the left panel of  shows the mean level of gross sales for the book genre. Young Adult has the highest average sales, followed by thriller and Non-fiction has the lowest average sale of the book genre categories. The right panel shows the estimates of the difference in average sales for the different book genre. 

# Question 2 Section 1
![](Effect of the marketing budget and season upon gross takings.png)

From Fig above, we can see the impact of marketing budget and retailer featured on gross sales.

From the analysis below, we can deduce that:

Marketing budget significantly predicts the gross sales of the books.The gross sales increases by  1.373e+00 for every extra percentage point of marketing_budget, this increase is significant t(398)=7.29, p=1.73e-12 . Gross sales increases by 1.37 95% CI [1.002327e+00 -  1.743227] for every extra marketing budget 

Gross sales reduces by 64,772.39 95% CI [-1.050501e+05 - 24,494] for every extra retailer featured. The gross sales reduces by 6.477e+04 for every extra percentage point of retailer featured, this reduction is significant t(398)=-3.161, p=0.002

Adding production budget does not improve the accyracy of the prediction for gross sales. The gross sales increases by 2.067e-01 for every extra percentage point of production budget, this increase is not significantly different from zero, t(398)=1.35, p=0.18. Gross sales increases by 0.206 95% CI [-9.550165e-02-  5.089137e-01] for every extra production budget
